This has lead us to where we are today. A brand centered around investment pieces made for the modern woman, seeking a timeless & premium wardrobe.<\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em><strong>Where are our pieces made and designed?<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p><p>We hand design everything in-house in London. Every piece that we design goes through a rigorous sampling process which is carried out by myself (Leanna, the founder). We only release items that we 100% love and know that you will too. We take into consideration quality, fit and fabric, so that not only do you look amazing when wearing NOVO but you also feel it. <\/p><p>We have an eye for detail and it’s imperative that our items are unique to us, as you’ll notice from the NOVO embroidery incorporated across every piece in our range.<\/p><p>We predominantly manufacture in Turkey, where we have a fantastic relationship with our manufacturers. We regularly visit them to discuss future collections and designs, to ensure a seamless transition from sketch or CAD to creation. <\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em><strong>How is NOVO sustainable?<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p><p>For us it’s important to be as sustainable as possible and we’re always looking for ways to improve our carbon footprint. We use the best quality fabrics with the intention being that they last a lifetime. The premise of NOVO is to move consumers away from constantly chasing trends and to encourage them to adapt a slower based approach to fashion, which is based around more considered purchases. We encourage thinking about cost per wear when purchasing and ensure you get the most use out of your pieces. Rather than purchasing something that is ‘on-trend’ and worn once which decreases its value. <\/p><p>Additionally our packaging is recyclable and we are looking at ways to improve further. Having our manufacturers in Europe reduces our carbon footprint when it comes to shipping stock to the UK.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","button_style":"primary","align_text":"center","layout":"right","divider":false}},"1c64e1f0-1ea7-4546-8f1d-5e5e0d51a3e6":{"type":"text-and-image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/IMG_5687.jpg","image_width":500,"subtitle":"","title":"About Me Personally","text":"<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em><strong>Are you an extrovert or an introvert? And, what do you get up to in your free time?<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p><p>I’d consider myself to be both, I would say that I love my own company and really enjoy time alone, however I thrive when around other people. For example, in my free time I love going to the gym and staying active. I rarely sit still, I enjoy being on-the-go and this includes dinner with friends, events etc. I’m a <strong>yes<\/strong> person!

And, how do you think that NOVO represents you?<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p><p>I’m very classic, personally I’m not a fan of big prints or big flash colours or big bold logos. I like to be very minimal and timeless and I love the fact that with NOVO you can wear all the items together and mix and match to make different combinations of outfits, it’s perfect for when you’re packing for a long weekend as the pieces are so versatile and can be styled in so many ways which ties into the minimalism theme.<\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em><strong>How did you get into fashion?<\/strong><\/em><\/span><\/p><p>When I was 13 I watched the Devil Wears Prada. I was obsessed. I wanted to be Meryl Streep and from that moment on I knew I wanted to do something in the fashion industry, which led me into modelling at 13 years old. After modelling for a number of years I wanted to have more control of my life and schedule, I always knew that I wanted to have my own business (preferably in fashion) given I went to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fashionretailacademy.ac.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.fashionretailacademy.ac.uk\/\">Fashion Retail Academy<\/a> in London where I studied merchandising and buying.
